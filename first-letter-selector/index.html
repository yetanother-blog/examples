      <p class="paragraph">
        That year, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee
        introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to
        send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of
        information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve. Berners-Lee
        created the Internet that we know today.

        Since then, the internet has changed in many ways. In 1992, a group of
        students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a
        sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. (It later became
        Netscape.) Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It
        allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first
        time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.

      <p class="paragraph">
        That same year, Congress decided that the Web could be used for
        commercial purposes. As a result, companies of all kinds hurried to set
        up websites of their own, and e-commerce entrepreneurs began to use the
        internet to sell goods directly to customers. More recently, social
        networking sites like Facebook have become a popular way for people of
        all ages to stay connected.
