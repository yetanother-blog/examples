          An accordion is a list of headers that hide or reveal additional
          content when selected/opened. You may see them often on FAQ pages,
          where it makes it easy for users to scan the list of questions without
          getting distracted by answers and a lot of text, and giving them
          control by clicking on the questions that pertain to them.

        When should I use an accordion?

          There are 3 general principles that should be considered when using
          accordions: reducing cognitive load, increasing readability, and
          clarity. Accordions are most appropriate when users will only need a
          few specific pieces of content within a page or if you have only a
          small space to display a lot of content.

          While they can make a web page easier to read, accordions should be
          used in moderation elements to describe situations or deliver
          information clearly. If users need to see most or all of the
          information on a page, it is better to use well-formatted text
          instead.
